We are a group of people who strive to achieve greatness. This, is our map for the road. The window from where we look at what's going on, and how we see the future. This work is developed to encourage people who may be hesitant about following their passion, but it is also a cautionary-tale.

We do not presume to be able to teach **Greatness** as it cannot be really teached.

We started this document in the need for a public asset to guide us for the achievement of **Greatness**.
We think that **Greatness** is a value that anyone has the right to pursuit; like happiness. Indeed, as well as the happiness, **Greatness** is a human being right, and for those that want to generate such big positive impact on society, an obligation.

###Writen by humans for humans

What makes our race great, and has had let us to progress over time, is a set of values like emphaty, love, commitment, passion, and the ability of share. By sharing we make ourselves a collaborative race, then we share our knowledge, cheating the trap of mortality. A human life is short, but knowledge can live forever as long as we share it.
We're glad to being born in times where information can be shared widely.
We're glad to being born in times where humankind has moved forward far away. And we're looking forward to see what's comming for us.
